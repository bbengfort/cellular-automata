# Cellular Automata [![Build Status][travis_img]][travis_url] #
Animated Cellular Automata using Matplotlib

[Cellular automata][cellular_automaton] are models of dynamical systems in discrete time, space, and state inspired by the work of [Jon von Neumann][vonneumann] in the 1950s. He conceived of a world of machines (cells) inhabiting a chessboard space, but instead of simply being black or red, the machine's state was identified by its color. These models are used often in [Artificial Life][artificial_life] Simulations as well as parallel computational devices because the illustrate the following fundamentals of natural computing:

* explicit space and time
* [locality for massive parallelism][massive_parallel]
* [self-organization][self_organization]
* [emergent properties][emergence]
* lifelike behavior

For my part- they are extremely cool, and programming them is extremely fun. Although there are many tools and animations for building visual Cellular Automata, I found very little in the way of Python libraries. This library uses [matplotlib 1.3.1][matplotlib] to animate the behavior of cellular automata, and allows a researcher to use Python to build and visualize these very cool looking machines!

## Usage ##
Currently, you can view the R90 animation with a simple command:

    $ bin/pyca

This should launch the animation in its own window. If you're having trouble, remember to ensure that the `pyca` module is on the Python path. If you're using `virtualenv`, you may have to add a .pth file to the site packages folder of the environment.

## Dependencies ##
This library depends on Python data libraries, particularly matplotlib and numpy. These libraries have a lot of compiling under the hood; you need to ensure that you have a Fortran compiler, and that you have ffmpeg libraries installed. Installing on a Mac (which this was developed on) is also notoriously difficult, so there are some Mac-specific hacks in the code. If you're getting errors trying to get the program to run, don't fear; it might not be the code, just the coder! Feel free to leave an issue and we'll sort it out together.
